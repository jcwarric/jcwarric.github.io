				<h3>Background</h3>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 ">
					<p>The Diocese of Saginaw underwent a comprehensive evaluation process to determine the best use of resources and staff for all parishes in the diocese.
					As part of the process, every parish was asked to assess its strengths, name concerns and explore ways in which it could work with other parishes to better serve the People of God in the work of evangelization.
					This process resulted in the establishment of some new parishes in the dioceses and locally. In the Midland area, three churches were merged into one (Our Lady of Grace), while Blessed Sacrament, St. Brigid of Kildare and Assumption of the BVM maintained their existing status. No parishes closed.
					The Midland Area Catholic Community has partnered to offer joint programs since 2000, and will look for more opportunities as we evolve with the changing dynamics of our Catholic Community.
					</p>

				<h3>Benefits of Partnership</h3>

				<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
					<p>Each parish in the MACC family has strengths that can be used for the benefit of the larger church. By sharing resources, the MACC can continue to offer a rich sacramental experience, engage more Catholics and enhance the ability to share our faith with others.
					Parishes in the MACC offer a vibrant social, educational and sacramental experience by cooperating when possible, yet honoring traditions of individual faith communities when practical. The intent is not to strip individual parishes of their uniqueness but rather to redefine our idea of “church.” By expanding our understanding of “church” to extend beyond parish boundaries, each parishioner can have a fuller, richer experience.

				<h3>The Future</h3>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
					<p>The parishes in the MACC will continue to work more and more closely together to share and nurture the gifts of each community and every individual in service of the common good and God’s promised future. The hope is that, over time, parishioners identify less and less with their “church buildings” and more and more with their Catholic Community. This means parishioners will be as comfortable at any one of the Midland-area Catholic churches as they are at their current home parish. As Catholics, we share a strong, common faith foundation, and this will support us, even as our parish structures change.</p>
