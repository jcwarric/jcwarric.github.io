			      	<h3>Attendees</h3>
			      	<ul>
			      		<li>Our Lady of Grace: Fr. Dan, Pat Brenner</li>
			      		<li>Blessed Sacrament: Fr. Kevin, Jim Marinik</li>
			      		<li>St. Brigid:  Fr. Andy, Kathy Smith</li>
			      		<li>Assumption:  Fr. Joe, Matt Glaccum, Noreen Warrick</li>
			      		<li>Excused:  Michael Knopff, Anne Marie Graham</li>
			      	</ul>
			        <p>Fr. Joe led prayer using Bishop Untener’s reflection,<a href="http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/prayers-and-devotions/prayers/prophets-of-a-future-not-our-own.cfm"> Prophets of a Future Not Our Own</a>.

			         </p>
			        <p>Fr. Andy provided a brief update on Anne Marie’s recovery.  All are holding Anne Marie in prayer for a full and easy recovery.</p>
			        <p>In Steve Schweinsberg’s absence, Noreen explained the lack of communication and engagement with the music directors regarding the MACC choir’s participation at the Loons event.  The lesson is that we need to be mindful of maintaining good lines of communication with parish leadership so ideas are heard proposals supported at an early stage.</p>
			        <p>Loons announcements are appearing in the bulletins.  Jim Marinik is checking with Luke at Blessed Sacrament to ensure announcements are appearing.  Parishes will run the announcements through the end of April and then as space permits.  To ensure the ordering system is running smoothly, PAT members agreed to order tickets and advise Noreen of any difficulties.</p>

			        <p>Fr. Kevin provided an update on the search for the mission speaker, noting that Fathers Manalo and Fragomeni have expressed a keen interest in participating.  Fr. Dan reflected that the partnership of Sr. Anne and Fr. Jim was an important part of our first mission and itself demonstrated partnership.  The PAT encouraged Fr. Kevin and Noreen to explore whether the speakers have ideas on partnership.  Names mentioned in connection with Fr. Fragomeni were Sisters Barbara Reid and Dianne Bergant.  Names mentioned in connection with Fr. Manalo were Dan Schutte and Sara Hart.  Fr. Kevin and Noreen will contact each of Fathers Fragomeni and Manalo to assess fit, including willingness to co-present, fees, support needed, accommodation needs.</p>

			        <p>Matt reminded the PAT that 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the celebration of the first Mass in Midland at a home across from the Loons stadium on St. Xavier’s feast day.  The PAT supports commemorating this event in a special way that doesn’t detract from the MACC picnic.</p>

			        <p>Matt provided an update on the Communications team.  Membership has waned.  Barb Rice is coordinating a contest to engage our youth in designing an MACC logo using the approach developed by the Knights in connection with their Christmas art contest for the youth.  Matt and Phil continue to work on the Google calendar.  The PAT affirmed the work of the Committee and sees its work as critical to advancing inter-parish participation in events.</p>

			        <p>Noreen provided an update on the Lay Ministry meeting.  This has yet to be scheduled.  The PAT acknowledged that parish lay ministers are already quite engaged in parish activities and may not have bandwidth to take on more responsibilities.  The PAT encouraged the meeting to continue to build inter-parish community in the hope that ideas for improved partnering are identified and carried forward.</p>

			        <p>Pat Benner provided an update on the Winterfest 2019 event.  This event is on-course.  No assistance is requested at this time.</p>

			        <p>Discussion ensued regarding the MACC Picnic.  With Anne Marie unavailable to chair the committee, Fr. Andy is reaching out other candidates at St. Brigid social committee.  This person will reach out to Pat Lautner and the other picnic committee members.  Based on Anne Marie’s last report, Pat Lautner has ordered most of the longer lead time items and picnic planning is on-course.</p>

			        <p>The next PAT meeting, the final meeting of the year, is scheduled for May 15th.  Blessed Sacrament is the hosting parish.  At this meeting, we will set the schedule for next year and revisit our goals.</p>

			        <p>Fr. Dan led us in closing prayer.<br><be>
